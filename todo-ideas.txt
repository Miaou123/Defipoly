Current focus:

Add shielding tracking in my backend (so ppl know if they can steal or not)
Need to rework the steal system (choose between targeted and untargetted and have it working)
Need to work on the backend and make sure it works properly
Need to test the new full deploy system with deploy:full

Todo:
Work on security (backend / frontend / program)
Quests system
Add 3d scaling houses when clicking on the property menu
fix the disparition bug from claiming when it's updated from blockchain every 30 sec/ same for leaderboard
Instead of 25% sell scaling (ui not right yet)

Maybe add a system to adjust rewards depending on the rewards pool size (more tokens in reward pool mode rewards, less tokens less rewards)

Give admin all rights (airdrop properties etc)

PDA changes:
Add the expand phase system for adding properties
Add an airdrop properties system for admin wallet (and other admins commands)
Steal system
Different family bonuses

Need to rethink prices etc because stealing would be too weak (need to add a cooldown to make sense but some users would already have 50+ of the property so it would be impossible to catch up)
