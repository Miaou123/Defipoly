Current focus:

Add shielding tracking in my backend (so ppl know if they can steal or not, added providers and propertystats for this, need to add it to the backend and store it properly etc): working (just need more test)

When shielding, even one property it shows the shield in modal but don't propose to shield more slots

show the steal option even when owning a property

Show the steal cooldown on the UI

Need to test the new full deploy system with deploy:full


Todo:
Work on security (backend / frontend / program)
Quests system
Add 3d scaling houses when clicking on the property menu
fix the disparition bug from claiming when it's updated from blockchain every 30 sec/ same for leaderboard
Instead of 25% sell scaling (ui not right yet)

When claiming reward need to instantly put it back to 0 (no keep counting until we check program for exact number)

Maybe add a system to adjust rewards depending on the rewards pool size (more tokens in reward pool mode rewards, less tokens less rewards)

Add blockchain checks call every X minutes to check for all backend data if its accurate (shield cooldown / steal cooldown / cooldowns etc) and give me warnings logs when there are disprecancies

Add system like addicted where people have to enter a code to play and then get 5 code etc

Give admin all rights (airdrop properties etc)

PDA changes:
Add the expand phase system for adding properties
Add an airdrop properties system for admin wallet (and other admins commands)
Steal system
Different family bonuses

Need to rethink prices etc because stealing would be too weak (need to add a cooldown to make sense but some users would already have 50+ of the property so it would be impossible to catch up)
